# Simple Auth App
This is a simple application for authentication. The core idea is to show how to implement an authentication system with [warden](https://github.com/wardencommunity/warden) strategies to make safe communication between Frontend and Backend via API.

## Features
1. Sign in/sign up by email/password;
2. Getting JWT after successful sign in/sign up;
3. Validation JWT on backend side;
4. Implementation Oauth authorization. Now, there is only one integration with Github using [omniauth-github](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-github).
